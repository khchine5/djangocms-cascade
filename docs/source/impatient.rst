For the Impatient

This HowTo gives you a quick instruction on how to get a demo of **djangocms-cascade** up and
running. It also is a good starting point to ask questions or report bugs, since its backend is
used as a fully functional reference implementation, used by the unit tests of project.


Create a Python Virtual Environment
===================================

To keep environments separate, create a virtual environment and install external dependencies.
Missing packages with JavaScript files and Style Sheets, which are not available via pip must be
installed via npm:

.. code-block:: bash


    $ git clone https://github.com/jrief/djangocms-cascade.git
    $ cd djangocms-cascade
    $ virtualenv cascadenv
    $ source cascadenv/bin/activate
    (cascadenv)$ pip install -r requirements/django19.txt
    (cascadenv)$ npm install


Initialize the database, create a superuser and start the development server:

.. code-block:: bash

    cd examples
    ./manage.py migrate
    ./manage.py createsuperuser
    ./manage.py runserver

Point a browser to http://localhost:8000/admin/login/?next=/ and log in as the super user you just
created. Hit "next" and fill out the form to create your first page. Afterwards, click **Structure**
on the top of the page.  Now a heading named **Main Content** appears. This heading symbolizes
our main **djangoCMS** Placeholder.

Locate the plus sign right to the heading and click on it. From its context menu select
**Container** located in the section **Bootstrap**:

|add-container|

.. |add-container| image:: _static/add-container.png

This brings you into the editor mode for a Bootstrap container. To this container you may add one or
more Bootstrap **Rows**. Inside these rows you may organize the layout using some Bootstrap
**Columns**.

Please proceed with the detailled explanation on how to use the
:ref:`Bootstrap's grid <bootstrap3/grid>` system within **djangocms-cascade**.
