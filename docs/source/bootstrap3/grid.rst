Bootstrap 3 Grid system
=======================
In order to take full advantage of **djangocms-cascade**, you should be familiar with the
concepts of the `Bootstrap Grid System`_, since all other Bootstrap components depend upon.

.. _Bootstrap Grid System: http://getbootstrap.com/css/#grid

Bootstrap Container
===================

A **Container** is the outermost component the Bootstrap framework knows of. Here the designer can
specify the breakpoints of a web page. By default, Bootstrap offers 4 breakpoints: “large”,
“medium”, “small” and “tiny”. These determine for which kind of screen widths, the grid system may
switch the layout.

The editor window for a Container element offers the possibility to deactivate certain breakpoints.
While this might make sense under certain conditions, it is safe to always keep all four breakpoints
active, since this gives the designer of the web page the maximum flexibility.

Small devices exclusively
-------------------------

If the web page shall be optimized just for small but not for large devices, then disable the
breakpoints for **Large** and/or **Medium**. In the project's style-sheets, the maximum width
of the container element then must be reduced to that chosen breakpoint:

.. code-block:: css

	@media(min-width: 1200px) {
	  .container {
	    max-width: 970px;
	  }
	}

or, if you prefers the SASS syntax:

.. code-block:: css

	@media(min-width: $screen-lg) {
	  .container {
	    max-width: $container-desktop;
	  }
	}


Large devices exclusively
-------------------------

If the web page shall be optimized just for large but not for small devices, then disable the
breakpoints for **Tiny** and/or **Small**.

Changing the style-sheets then is not required for this configuration setting.


Fluid Container
---------------

A variant of the normal Bootstrap Container is the Fluid Container. It can be enabled by a checkbox
in the editors window. Fluid Containers have no hards breakpoints, they adopt their width to
whatever the browser pretends and are slightly larger than their non-fluid counterpart.

A fluid container makes it impossible to determine the maximum width of responsive images for the
*large media breakpoint*, because it is applied whenever the browser width extends 1200 pixels,
but there is no upper limit. For responsive images in the smaller breakpoints (“tiny”, “small”
and “medium”) we use the width of the next larger breakpoint, but for images in the “large” media
breakpoints we somehow must specify an arbitrary maximum width. The default width is set to 1980
pixels, but can be changed, to say 2500 pixels, using the following configuration in your
``settings.py``:

.. code-block:: python

	CMSPLUGIN_CASCADE = {
	    ...
	    'bootstrap3': (
	        ('xs', (768, 'mobile', _("mobile phones"), 750, 768)),
	        ('sm', (768, 'tablet', _("tablets"), 750, 992)),
	        ('md', (992, 'laptop', _("laptops"), 970, 1200)),
	        ('lg', (1200, 'desktop', _("large desktops"), 1170, 2500)),
	    ),
	}

.. note:: Fluid container are specially useful for Hero images, full-width Carousels and the
	Jumbotron plugin. When required, add a free standing fluid container to the placeholder and as
	it's only child, use the picture or carousel plugin. Its content then is stretched to the
	browser's full width.

Bootstrap Row
=============

Each Bootstrap Container may contain one or more Bootstrap Rows. A row does not accept any
configuration setting. However, while editing, one can specify the number of columns. When adding or
changing a row, then this number of columns are added if its value exceeds the current number of
columns. Reducing the number of columns does not delete any of them; they must explicitly be chosen
from the context menu in structure view.

|edit-row|

Horizontal Rule
===============

A horizontal rule is used to separate rows optically from each other.

|rule-editor|

.. |rule-editor| image:: /_static/rule-editor.png


Column
======

In the column editor, one can specify the width, the offset and the visibility of each column.
These values can be set for each of the four breakpoints (*tiny*, *small*, *medium* and *large*),
as specified by the Container plugin.

At the beginning this may feel rather complicate, but consider that **Bootstrap 3 is mobile first**,
therefore all column settings, *first* are applied to the narrow breakpoints, which *later* can be
overridden for larger breakpoints at a later stage. This is the reason why this editor starts with
the *column widths* and *column offsets* for tiny rather than for large displays.

|edit-column|

.. |edit-column| image:: /_static/edit-column.png

.. note:: If the current column is member of a container which disables some of its breakpoints
          (*large*, *medium*, *small* or *tiny*), then that column editor shows up only with the
          input fields for the enabled breakpoints.


Complete DOM Structure
======================

After having added a container with different rows and columns, you may add the leaf plugins. These
hold the actual content, such as text and images.

|structure-container|

.. |structure-container| image:: /_static/structure-container.png

By pressing the button **Publish changes**, the single blocks are regrouped and displayed using
the Bootstrap's grid system.


Adding Plugins into a hard coded grid
=====================================

Sometimes the given Django template already defines a Bootstrap Container, or Row inside a Container
element. Example:

.. code-block:: html

	<div class="container">
	    {% placeholder "Row Content" %}
	</div>

or

.. code-block:: html

	<div class="container">
	    <div class="row">
	        {% placeholder "Column Content" %}
	    </div>
	</div>

Here the Django templatetag ``{% placeholder "Row Content" %}`` requires a Row- rather than a
Container-plugin; and the templatetag ``{% placeholder "Column Content" %}`` requires a
Column-plugin. Hence we must tell **djangocms-cascade** which breakpoints shall be allowed and what
the containers extensions shall be. This must be hard-coded inside your ``setting.py``:

.. code-block:: python

	CMS_PLACEHOLDER_CONF = {
	    # for a row-like placeholder configuration ...
	    'Row Content': {
	        'plugins': ['BootstrapRowPlugin'],
	        'parent_classes': {'BootstrapRowPlugin': []},
	        'require_parent': False,
	        'glossary': {
	            'breakpoints': ['xs', 'sm', 'md', 'lg'],
	            'container_max_widths': {'xs': 750, 'sm': 750, 'md': 970, 'lg': 1170},
	            'fluid': False,
	            'media_queries': {
	                'xs': ['(max-width: 768px)'],
	                'sm': ['(min-width: 768px)', '(max-width: 992px)'],
	                'md': ['(min-width: 992px)', '(max-width: 1200px)'],
	                'lg': ['(min-width: 1200px)'],
	            },
	        }
	    },
	    # or, for a column-like placeholder configuration ...
	    'Colummn Content': {
	        'plugins': ['BootstrapColumnPlugin'],
	        'parent_classes': {'BootstrapColumnPlugin': []},
	        'require_parent': False,
	        'glossary': {
	            'breakpoints': ['xs', 'sm', 'md', 'lg'],
	            'container_max_widths': {'xs': 750, 'sm': 750, 'md': 970, 'lg': 1170},
	            'fluid': False,
	            'media_queries': {
	                'xs': ['(max-width: 768px)'],
	                'sm': ['(min-width: 768px)', '(max-width: 992px)'],
	                'md': ['(min-width: 992px)', '(max-width: 1200px)'],
	                'lg': ['(min-width: 1200px)'],
	            },
	        }
	    },
	}

Please refer to the `DjangoCMS documentation`_ for details about these settings with the exception
of the dictionary ``glossary``. This latter setting is special to **djangocms-cascade**: It gives
the placeholder the ability to behave like a plugin for the Cascade app. Remember, each
**djangocms-cascade** plugin stores all of its settings inside a Python dictionary which is
serialized into a single database field. By having a placeholder behaving like a plugin, here this
so named *glossary* is emulated using an additional entry inside the setting
``CMS_PLACEHOLDER_CONF``, and it should:

- include all the settings a child plugin would expect from a real container plugin
- reflect how hard coded container was defined (e.g. whether it is fluid or not)

.. _DjangoCMS documentation: https://django-cms.readthedocs.org/en/latest/basic_reference/configuration.html#std:setting-CMS_PLACEHOLDER_CONF


Nested Columns and Rows
=======================

One of the great features of Bootstrap is the ability to nest Rows inside Columns. These nested Rows
then can contain Columns of 2nd level order. A quick example:

.. code-block:: html

	<div class="container">
	  <div class="row">
	    <div class="col-md-3">
	      Left column
	    </div>
	    <div class="col-md-9">
	      <div class="row">
	        <div class="col-md-6">
	          Left nested column
	        </div>
	        <div class="col-md-6">
	          Right nested column
	        </div>
	      </div>
	    </div>
	  </div>
	</div>

rendered, it would look like:

|nested-rows|

.. |nested-rows| image:: /_static/nested-rows.png

If a responsive image shall be placed inside a column, we must estimate the width of this image, so
that when rendered, it fits exactly into that column. We want easy-thumbnails_ to resize our images
to the columns width and not having the browser to up- or down-scale them.

.. _easy-thumbnails: https://github.com/SmileyChris/easy-thumbnails

Therefore **djangocms-cascade** keeps track of all the breakpoints and the chosen column widths.
For simplicity, this example only uses the breakpoint “medium”. The default Boostrap settings for
this width is 992 pixels. Doing simple math, the outer left column widths gives
3 / 12 * 992 = 248 pixels. Hence, adding a responsive image to that column means, that
**easy-thumnails** automatically resizes it to a width of 248 pixels.

To calculate the width of the nested columns, first evaluate the width of the outer right column,
which is 9 / 12 * 992 = 744 pixels. Then this width is subdivided again, using the the width of the
nested columns, which is 6 / 12 * 744 = 372 pixels.

These calculations are always performed recursively for all nested column and for all available
breakpoints.

.. warning:: As the name implies, a container marked as *fluid*, does not specify a fixed width.
	Hence instead of the inner width, the container's outer width is used as its maximum. For the
	large media query (with a browser width of 1200 pixels or more), the maximum width is limited
	to 1980 pixels.
